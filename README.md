This is a minimal skeleton viewer that will run inside your locker and let 
you easily build your own experiences of your data.

Be sure to note the repository section of the package.json.  There are a few
key fields to understand:

* uses - field defines the types and services that the application uses.  These 
also allow people to quickly sort and find your application in the explorer.  
* type - should be set to "app"
* static - should be true
* title - This is the title displayed in the explorer, the name field in the main
package.json is used for the package name, not display.
